# Hackathon Connectiwise
This repository is part of Hackathon organised by Connectiwise in 2019. 

### Problem statement which is based on real world scenario is as follows; 
Client sites are situated all across the globe where physical sensors are installed which are sending weather data such as humidity, temperature, wind speed etc. every 5 minutes. 
As sensors are placed all across the globe, problem statement was to build big data application to handle such high flux input data. 

## Client should be able to perform following operations ; 
  * Execute queries to fetch historical data 
  * Dashboard to visualize real time and historical data and sensor health
